## Run 1 -- temperature=0.2  |  A=Study C, B=Study A

| Dimension | Analysis A (1-5) | Analysis B (1-5) |
|-----------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| 1. Mechanistic Accuracy | 5 | 5 |
| 2. Insight Depth | 5 | 5 |
| 3. Critical Rigor | 5 | 4 |
| 4. Breadth of Perspective | 5 | 3 |
| 5. Calibration | 5 | 4 |
| 6. Usefulness | 5 | 4 |

**Overall preference:** A clearly

**Justification (3-5 sentences):** 
Analysis A provides a significantly deeper microarchitectural critique, specifically identifying subtle hardware implications like L1 critical path timing, memory controller bandwidth overheads, and TSH multi-cycle delays in large ROBs. It also demonstrates a much broader perspective by connecting the mechanism to real-world software ecosystems (Scudo, KASAN) and specific hardware deployments (Pixel 8), whereas Analysis B mostly restricts itself to the paper's own related work. While Analysis B is highly accurate and well-written, Analysis A acts as a true expert peer reviewer, extracting both the philosophical elegance of the paper and its hidden physical costs.

## Run 2 -- temperature=0.3  |  A=Study C, B=Study A

| Dimension | Analysis A (1-5) | Analysis B (1-5) |
|-----------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| 1. Mechanistic Accuracy | 5 | 4 |
| 2. Insight Depth | 5 | 5 |
| 3. Critical Rigor | 5 | 4 |
| 4. Breadth of Perspective | 5 | 3 |
| 5. Calibration | 5 | 4 |
| 6. Usefulness | 5 | 4 |

**Overall preference:** A clearly

**Justification (3-5 sentences):** 
Analysis A provides a significantly deeper and more precise evaluation of the paper across almost all dimensions. It excels in mechanistic accuracy by detailing the exact bit-widths, structural modifications, and state machine transitions, whereas B remains slightly more high-level. Furthermore, Analysis A demonstrates a superior breadth of perspective and critical rigor by connecting the work to real-world MTE software stacks (Scudo, KASAN), specific hardware deployments (Pixel/Galaxy), and identifying nuanced architectural issues like DDR5 memory bandwidth implications and the unquantified tag mismatch frequency.

## Run 3 -- temperature=0.3  |  A=Study C, B=Study A

| Dimension | Analysis A (1-5) | Analysis B (1-5) |
|-----------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| 1. Mechanistic Accuracy | 5 | 4 |
| 2. Insight Depth | 5 | 5 |
| 3. Critical Rigor | 5 | 4 |
| 4. Breadth of Perspective | 5 | 3 |
| 5. Calibration | 5 | 4 |
| 6. Usefulness | 5 | 4 |

**Overall preference:** A clearly

**Justification (3-5 sentences):** 
Analysis A provides a significantly deeper and more technically precise evaluation than Analysis B. It excels in critical rigor by identifying specific methodological gaps, such as the authors' failure to quantify actual tag mismatch rates versus instruction restriction rates, and the lack of RTL timing validation for the critical-path comparator. Furthermore, Analysis A demonstrates superior breadth by connecting the work to real-world MTE deployments (Pixel 8), specific software allocators (Scudo), and hardware constraints (DDR5 channel parallelization), making it an exceptionally useful and comprehensive preparatory document.
